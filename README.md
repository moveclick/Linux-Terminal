# Linux-Terminal
Linux terminal capable of file input/output redirection, running multiple background processes, and directory handling


A linux terminal that has been modified to add some quality of life features. The main additional features are input and output redirection, running multiple background processes, and directory handling. 

The terminal uses piping to achieve input output redirection. It is capable of taking the output of a command and using it as an input for a new command. 
The terminal is also able to run multiple commands at once, which is particularly useful for running commands that take a long time to process, such as file transfer.
Lastly, the terminal is able to switch through directories just as a standard terminal would be able to.
